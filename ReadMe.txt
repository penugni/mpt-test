Made few assumptions as per the description
downloaded jar file which supports the required standard deviation
results kept on fluctuating with each Junit testcase run which i think is as expected  
Result are something like
Portfolio Type =AGRESSIVE, Median=241897.70, Top 10=562120.51, Bottom 10=101514.36
Portfolio Type =VERY_CONSERVATIVE, Median=158390.50, Top 10=222946.01, Bottom 10=111607.30
